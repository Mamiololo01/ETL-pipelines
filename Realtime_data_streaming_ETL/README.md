## Introduction

This project employs a multifaceted technological stack to establish an end-to-end data processing pipeline. The workflow commences by fetching data from the randomuser.me API to generate synthetic user data. This raw data is subsequently channeled through Apache Airflow for data orchestration and storage in a PostgreSQL database.

The data is then streamed through Apache Kafka in conjunction with Apache Zookeeper to facilitate real-time data movement from PostgreSQL to the processing engine. For streamlined management and monitoring of Kafka streams, Control Center and Schema Registry are employed to handle schema configurations and ensure effective oversight of the data streams.

Subsequently, Apache Spark is utilized to conduct data processing tasks, following which the processed data is persisted in a Cassandra database, providing a durable storage solution for the refined information.

The entire pipeline is encapsulated within Docker containers, affording a streamlined and portable deployment mechanism.
